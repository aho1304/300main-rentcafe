    <p>6.3<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communications.</strong>&nbsp;Although we provide a platform through the Site and the Services through which third-parties may communicate, Company is not involved in those third-party communications and is not responsible or liable under any circumstances for the content of any third-party communications, or for any absence of communications by a third-party.

We are only responsible for the content of information issued directly by us. You acknowledge and agree that you will address any issues or concerns about third-party communications with the responsible third-party by contacting said third-party directly and not Company. Company shall not become involved in any matters pertaining to third-party communications except where the issue is solely attributable to a malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in connection with the Services.</p>
    
    <p>6.4<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renter Screening.</strong>&nbsp;As part of the Services, Users may be permitted to submit information through the Site for the purpose of conducting a User background check or screening on behalf of a property manager or owner (a &ldquo;Screening&rdquo;).

You must comply with all such terms in relation to such payments by you.</p>
    
    <p>By providing your card or bank information, you are representing that you are authorized to use this card or bank account for payments for rental deposits, rental payments, or any other services or transactions for services provided by a property manager, property owner or a party other than Yardi.&nbsp; If you are making a one-time payment, your card or bank information will not be stored after completion of the transaction, but any other personal information provided in connection with the transaction will be stored.&nbsp; If you are enrolling in recurring payments, you authorize Yardi to store your card or bank information to process your recurring payments. You are responsible for keeping your card or bank information up to date. If your card or bank information changes, you agree to promptly update your information. Yardi will continue to store your card or bank information until you delete your information or you cancel recurring payments.&nbsp; For more information about how we store and use your card, bank or other personal information, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>
